#Seabattles

###Seabattles is a Python termnal game, wich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can try to beat the computer by finding all five battleships with the 10 opportunities the game offers. Each battleship occupies one square on the board.

#How to play

Seabattles is based on the classic pen-and-paper game. You can read more about it on Wikipedia.

In this version, the player guess and choose a combination of a letter in a range from A to H in uppercases for the columns and a number from 1 to 8 for the rows to coordinate an attack on the hidden and randomly generated battleships on the playing board.

The guesses are marked with an X for a hit on a ship and - for a miss.
The ships only covers one mark each and there are five hidden

When and if the player hits all the five ships, then the player wins and the game is over, or if the player miss to hit all the five ships with the ten tries, then the game is also over.

#Features
